### PLA Premium

* Aesthetic, biodegradable and reliable 3D printing
  * Spectrum PLA Premium is a filament based on polylactide which belongs to aliphatic polymers. It shows full biodegradability. Carefully selected colour concentrates provide items manufactured of Spectrum PLA Premium with intense colours in a broad spectrum. Moreover, the choice of an appropriate dye base for the pellets for filament extrusion ensures a highly efficient printing with an extremely good adhesion of printed items to the build beds of FDM/FFF 3D printers.
  * An unquestionable advantage of Spectrum PLA Premium is a very low processing shrinkage. Thus, it is particularly useful for large-size 3D printers without a closed build-in chamber. Spectrum PLA Premium yields excellent surface quality and detail, producing reliable results.
  * The characteristics of the filament Spectrum PLA Premium determine its application as a training material for those who learn to employ the FDM/FFF additive manufacturing technologies. Moreover, on account of the extremely high aesthetic properties, the material is widely used in industrial design, specifically for concept and demo prototyping of designed finished and semi-finished products.
  * The material is also widely used for producing gadgets and company advertising aids as well as all kinds of toys, figurines, containers, handles and stands for interior design purposes.

### [Spectrum GreenyPro:](https://spectrumfilaments.com/en/filament/greenypro/)

* An innovative filament with versatile applications
  * GreenyPro is a new filament from the bio-performance series, created especially for demanding applications where efficiency, reliability and ease of printing are important. This innovative material is a response to the needs of engineers and creators who demand more from their projects and expect the best results.
  * GreenyPro is characterized by much higher impact resistance compared to standard PLA filaments. GreenyPro is also distinguished by other features, such as excellent plasticity (vs. classic PLA) and minimal warping during printing. Thanks to these properties, you can create durable and strong parts that are not subject to deformation. This is an ideal solution for applications where precision is key.
  * Temperature resistance is another significant advantage of GreenyPro, which highlights its versatility. This material achieves a VICAT temperature resistance of 160°C, making it an excellent choice for projects requiring thermal stability. Additionally, GreenyPro is characterized by a semi-matt print surface, giving 3D-printed objects elegance and a professional finish. GreenyPro is biodegradable according to DIN EN ISO 14855.
  * If you care about performance, reliability, excellent finish and temperature resistance, GreenyPro is the perfect choice. Discover new possibilities with GreenyPro filaments and take the quality of your projects to a higher level.
